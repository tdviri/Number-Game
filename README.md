# Number-Game
Arithmetic game using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery


The user will be shown a table of 25 cells, each assigned with a hidden random number from 1-9. The user's goal is to click on the cells that he/she thinks will
earn them the most points. However, there is no real way of knowing, as this is a game of luck. There are a total of five rounds in the game, and after each round, the user
earns a certain number of points depending on which numbers he/she recieved that round. After each round, if all 5 numbers match, a total of 100 points are added to the total score. 
If the numbers are consecutive numbers, then 80 points are added. If 4 of the numbers match, then 50 points are added. If 3 of the numbers match, then 20 points are added. If
there are no consecutive numbers or matches, then 25 points are deducted from the total score. Regardless of whether there are any wins that round or not, all of the numbers from
that round are added up and added to the total score. 
The user also has the choice to "stop", or skip the current round and advance to the next one. In this case, no points are added or lost that round. However, this may also
cause the user to miss out on a win, as the game will end at five rounds anyway. This is where the user has to take into consideration both luck and risk.
